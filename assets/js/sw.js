First, the app attempts to get resources online and response with the cached resources if that fetch fails (using the respondWith() ).
Within the respondWith() , we call fetch(event.request) to try to fetch resources from the network, and since fetch is Promise based, 
the Promise will reject if it fails to connect to the network and in turn, trigger the catch() statement.
In the catch() statement is where youâ€™d want to call your cached resources.
